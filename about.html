            <h2>An Observer or Participant</h2>
            <img src="images/Self Portrait-2.jpg" alt="Aaron near the LA River">
            <p>
                Aaron began photographing after leaving his job in city government and using his savings to buy a
                camera. His neighbor, Frank Xochihua, had introduced him to photography years earlier by taking the
                photo used for Aaron’s brother’s tombstone.
            </p>
            <p>
                He currently documents unhoused life along the Los Angeles River, focusing on the individuals and
                structures that exist outside of city-sanctioned housing. His work includes still photography, video,
                and field notes tied to specific locations and dates.
            </p>
            <p>
                He was born and raised in Highland Park, Los Angeles. He briefly studied chemical engineering at UC
                Berkeley before dropping out. He later enrolled at Pasadena City College, where he began photographing
                regularly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Aaron has worked as a decathlon coach, food cart attendant, casino chip collector, construction worker,
                environmental inspector, baby photographer, quinceañera photographer, and freelance photographer.
            </p>
            <p>
                He has collaborated with Marylou Juarez, a film student at Cal State Long Beach, and is working with
                Jimmy, a Colombian art director from Clika Underground, on a documentary about immigrant encampments and
                law enforcement interactions along the river.

            <h2>Process & Projects</h2>
            <p>
                This site is an evolving archive. It blends street photography, legal research, video, and oral
                documentation. It is directly informed by the documentary <em>No Other Land</em> and begins with the
                assumption that the most vulnerable must be attended to first.
            </p>
            <p>
                The project focuses on the Los Angeles River, particularly the section near Highland Park. It examines
                how changes in infrastructure, policing, and demographics affect people living unhoused along the river.
                Each entry is tied to a specific date and location. Images and links are presented alongside public
                records and policy timelines.
            </p>
            <p>
                The objective is to find observable patterns of state action and local neglect. This includes how
                encampments are removed, how residents are displaced, and how city policy is enforced or ignored.
            </p>
            <p>
                The work is informed by a duty to love one's neighbor, as expressed by Søren Kierkegaard. Documentation
                is used here as a form of accountability and witness.

            <p>
                If you’re interested in volunteering, consider starting by simply stopping and talking to people who are
                living unhoused. Ask how they’re doing. Offer something if you can.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you’re not comfortable doing that directly, there are organizations that work with residents along
                the Los Angeles River. One of them is <a href="https://neno-la.org/" target="_blank">Northeast Neighbors
                    Organization (NENO)</a>, which helps provide food, supplies, and community support.
